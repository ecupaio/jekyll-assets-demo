No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. I guess you can say I'm buy-curious. 

What's up, fizz-ellas. Daddy horny, Michael. These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing. I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. 

Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot… your wife is dead! Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. Barry: You said spanking. I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing!  So we don't get dessert? 

You're blowing my mind, Frank. There are dozens of us! DOZENS! Hey, look at that – you're mean sober, too. What, so the guy we are meeting with can't even grow his own hair? COME ON! 

Sure, let the little fruit do it. HUZZAH! Speaking of settling, how's Ann? Speaking of settling, How's Ann? Fun and failure both start out the same way. Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist", yes. Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. Everybody dance NOW. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? 

If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. George Bush doesn't care about black puppets. If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON. I see you've wasted no time in filling my seat hole. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. [earlier] I don't care for Gob. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. 

If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. 

Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken!  ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. However, she mistook the drowsy eye alcohol warning for a winking eye alcohol suggestion. It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. I didn't mean who… I meant… her? Pound is tic-tac-toe right? 

Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of funny. I'll sacrifice anything for my children. 

Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? You were just a turd out there, you know? You couldn't kick, and you couldn't run, you know? You were just a turd. It's OUR nausea. I will be a bigger and hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh! If that man's straight, then I am sober. She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear.
