I'm foolish and I'm funny and I'm needy. Am I needy? Are you sure I'm not needy? 'Cause I feel needy sometimes. I'M A MONSTER!! When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. Heart attack never stopped old big bear. I'm not interested in you that way. Tobias: What way? Michael: Pick one. I'm gonna go get sexy. He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. 

What about macaroni – let me finish – salad?  

Are you at all concerned about an uprising? He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. What about macaroni – let me finish – salad? 

Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. Are you aware of this?  Coming soon. Indeed. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted. Look what the homosexuals have done to me! You can't just comb that out and reset it? There's a new daddy in town. A discipline daddy. 

Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. Hola, is Rosa still alive? No? Well this is not my day. Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere in the OC? Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.  Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. Yeah, I invited her. You said you wanted to spend time some with her. You said I was being an Ann hog. I'm foolish and I'm funny and I'm needy. Am I needy? Are you sure I'm not needy? 'Cause I feel needy sometimes. 

Speaking of settling, How's Ann? One for the ladies. So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. But I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had to have the crotch taken in a little bit. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass! I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. 

♪♪ Somewhere… over the rainbow… there's another rainbow… ♪♪ You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. Way to plant, Ann! And I am rock steady. No more dizzies. Talk you off what, Pop Pop? If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. [earlier] I don't care for Gob. "Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob: The old "reach around." If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. 

My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. Heyyyyy, hermano. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw. Go ahead, touch the cornballer. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. 

What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. Yeah, I invited her. You said you wanted to spend time some with her. You said I was being an Ann hog. A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. 

Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist", yes. No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. George Bush doesn't care about black puppets.
