No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being WITH you. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. Everybody dance NOW. 

They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong? I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? A trick is something a whore does for money…or candy.  … or cocaine. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? I'll never forget your wedding. Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. 

Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? 

Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. Fun and failure both start out the same way. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! ♪♪ It ain't easy being white… ♪♪ Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. 

It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. Heart attack never stopped old big bear. 

Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! I am getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and self-respect. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking.  That's not what I WAS thinking. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. 

She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. Today I learned this is a real place, tho more lush than the OC. Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual intercourse. There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out. Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. What's up, fizz-ellas. Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. 

We all need to pick a day to try and make trend. Pound is tic-tac-toe right? Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers! Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! 

It just seems like there's still light coming in from under the door. They frame my junk. 

In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. You're Killing Me, Buster. I've made a huge tiny mistake. Annhog's coming?
