title: Michael was concerned that he was caught in.
---

Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. 

Quicken! Premiere! She calls it a mayonegg. God knows they're squinters. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! A trick is something a whore does for money…or candy.  … or cocaine. I think that's one of Mom's little fibs, you know, like I'll sacrifice anything for my children. You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. 

Perhaps an attic shall I seek. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! 

I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot… your wife is dead! You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. I think that's one of Mom's little fibs, you know, like I'll sacrifice anything for my children. Happy Franklin Friday. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." 

I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. 

Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. I didn't mean who… I meant… her? NO TOUCHING! So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! 

They don't allow you to have bees in here. Annyong. 

She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? I need a fake passport, preferably to France… I like the way they think. Are you at all concerned about an uprising? I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? I'll never forget your wedding. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper. 

So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! I don't appreciate the dry British humor. 

You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. Annyong. I didn't mean who… I meant… her? I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray. It's OUR nausea. ♪♪ Big yellow joint, big yellow joint, I'll meet you down at the big yellow joint. ♪♪
