I'M A MONSTER!! ♪♪ Big yellow joint, big yellow joint, I'll meet you down at the big yellow joint. ♪♪ 

Mission Accomplished. ¡Soy loco por los Cornballs! ♪♪ Somewhere… over the rainbow… there's another rainbow… ♪♪ Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass! This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. 

How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. 

They frame my junk. Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. ♪♪ And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting. Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon delight! ♪♪ So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. 

George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." Who? i just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of ann. Happy Franklin Friday. If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. 

A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties. Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. You might enjoy this.  Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. You might wanna lean away from that fire since you're soaked in alcohol. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. 

A night of heterosexual intercourse. What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese?  Hahahahah! I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! Are you aware of this?  Coming soon. Indeed. You might wanna lean away from that fire since you're soaked in alcohol. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. 

Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. Everybody dance… NOW. Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? 

Turn this skiff around! Annhog's coming? I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON. What have we always said is the most important thing? Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo. 

The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. Way to plant, Ann! Mister gay is bleeding! Mister gay! Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. Why are you squeezing me with your body? Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength?
