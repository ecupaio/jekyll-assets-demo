The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers! Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay.

Yeah. Mom's awesome. 

Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON. He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one.  Family Love Michael. Today I learned this is a real place, tho more lush than the OC. I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? 

There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. I hear the jury's still out on science. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. ♪♪ Big yellow joint, big yellow joint, I'll meet you down at the big yellow joint. ♪♪ She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. 

Everybody dance… NOW. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? Those are balls. 

I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball! I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. Monday morning. COME ON! Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. He's going to be all right. Sure, let the little fruit do it. HUZZAH! Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. 

I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! Hair up, glasses off.
