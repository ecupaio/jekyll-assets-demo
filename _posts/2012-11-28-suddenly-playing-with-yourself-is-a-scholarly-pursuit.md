title: Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit.
---

Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears. GENE!! [screams] When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. 

A million [bleep]ing diamonds! Steve Holt? The moron jock? I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona. Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship. ♪♪ It ain't easy being white… ♪♪ Everybody dance NOW. Monday morning. COME ON! 

You might enjoy this.  Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? 

Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? One for the ladies. Annhog's coming? Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere on the OC? Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. 

It's ok. You be with Yam. Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her. 

Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. It just seems like there's still light coming in from under the door. Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine. Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her. What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. 

But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. [Stabbing Gob] White power! Gob: I'm white! However, she mistook the drowsy eye alcohol warning for a winking eye alcohol suggestion. The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn? A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. Chickens don't clap! 

Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. Who? i just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of ann. 

GENE!! [screams] You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! Are you sure this isn't her sister? Mrs Veal: What a lovely thing to say. Michael: That's an awful thing to say. Are you aware of this?  Coming soon. Indeed. I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. Go ahead, touch the cornballer. 

I am getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and self-respect. You stay on top of her, Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. When a man needs to prove to a woman that he's actually… When a man loves a woman… No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you.
