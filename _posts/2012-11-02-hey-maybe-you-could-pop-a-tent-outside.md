title: Hey maybe you could pop a tent outside.
---

Hey, maybe you could pop a tent outside with your cousin Maeby… it'd be a good chance to rub off on her. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. Heart attack never stopped old big bear! There's a girl in my soup! 

Sure, let the little fruit do it. HUZZAH! I'll sacrifice anything for my children. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. I think that's one of Mom's little fibs, you know, like I'll sacrifice anything for my children. George Bush doesn't care about black puppets. Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. 

Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where? Bob Loblaw Law Blog. Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F*** me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. 

Hey, maybe you could pop a tent outside with your cousin Maeby… it'd be a good chance to rub off on her. The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. 

Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. You're blowing my mind, Frank. Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. [earlier] I don't care for Gob. A million [bleep]ing diamonds! That's my son, you pothead! I [bleeped] the business model. Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms. 

If mother sees this, she will blow a cow. Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit. 

Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn? Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. 

I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. 

My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted. Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. 

Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. But where did the lighter fluid come from?
