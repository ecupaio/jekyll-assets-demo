So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. And THAT'S why you always leave a note. 

What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it. Turn this skiff around! I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! 

Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! 

For the same reason you should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies! Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear. You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. Chickens don't clap! Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken!  ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. Chaw-chee, chaw-chee chaw-chee! Coo coo ca cha! Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. 

He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. Even it means me taking a chubby… I will suck it up. Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her. I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit. 

I'm sure, wherever your father is, she loves you very much. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy. I made a huge tiny mistake. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. 

♪♪ Big yellow joint, big yellow joint, I'll meet you down at the big yellow joint. ♪♪ Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. I should be in this Poof. I made a huge tiny mistake. Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on the balcony until zip-up, and yet anything goes at bath time. He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. 

It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. Let's see some bananas and nuts! Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. 

Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw. So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. I think that's one of Mom's little fibs, you know, like I'll sacrifice anything for my children. Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. 

I'm gonna go get sexy. Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F*** me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it. Go ahead, touch the cornballer. Oh, COME ON!
