Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. It's a gaming ship. The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. 

Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well, then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. That was Tom Cruise, the actor. Lucille: They said he was some kind of scientist. Oh…yeah…the guy in the…the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. I think I might have someone who's going to circumvrent the law. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? I'll never forget your wedding. Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. 

You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. Perhaps an attic shall I seek. You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. 

She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! I hear the jury's still out on science. 

Why are you squeezing me with your body? That was Tom Cruise, the actor. Lucille: They said he was some kind of scientist. Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing. Speaking of settling, How's Ann? I'm gonna go get sexy. 

Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? Come on, this is a Bluth family celebration. It's no place for children. There are dozens of us! Dozens! Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. 

You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. Everybody dance… NOW. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Why are you squeezing me with your body? 

Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. 

When a man needs to prove to a woman that he's actually… When a man loves a woman… Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. 

Well, they got the Asian right… "hotties" might be a stretch. Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. Oh Gob, you could charm the black off a telegram boy. Do you have any idea how often you say the word afraid? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. Go ahead, touch the cornballer.
