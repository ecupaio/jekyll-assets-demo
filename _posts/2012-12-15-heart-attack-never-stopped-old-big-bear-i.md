title: Heart attack never stopped old big bear I.
---

Heart attack never stopped old big bear. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. Monday morning. COME ON! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. 

Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. I got Michael out of his marriage, didn't I? Actually, she died. 

You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. I made a huge tiny mistake. But where did the lighter fluid come from? Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens. Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. 

Interfere? I ought to pull down your pants and spank your ass raw. Michael: I'm sorry, have we met? I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. 

Friend of mine from college. He also has a boat tho not called the Seaward. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. I cheated and I lied and I whored around. The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? 

Daddy horny, Michael. One for the ladies. Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. Barry: You said spanking. I'm not interested in you that way. Tobias: What way? Michael: Pick one. Please refrain from Mayoneggs during this salmonella scare. 

No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. 

It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. If that man's straight, then I am sober. I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray. What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. 

It walked on my pillow! I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. Yeah, I invited her. You said you wanted to spend time some with her. You said I was being an Ann hog. You want your belt to buckle, not your chair. I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona. They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. 

You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. I made a huge tiny mistake. Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. I made a huge tiny mistake.
