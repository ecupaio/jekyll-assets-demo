title: Talk you off what Pop Pop With spicy.
---

Talk you off what, Pop Pop? With spicy club sauce. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. Even it means me taking a chubby… I will suck it up. 

Pound is tic-tac-toe right? Well, Michael, I did not find their buffoonery amusing. I may have committed some light treason. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! No, she's in it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. 

I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? There are dozens of us! DOZENS! Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn? Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. ♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy being brown. ♪♪ You might enjoy this.  Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. 

It walked on my pillow! It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. Chickens don't clap! The only person that gets Lucille this excited is Gene. 

Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. Am I in two thirds of a hospital room? George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." Turn this skiff around! 

Heyyyyy, hermano. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. 

I got Michael out of his marriage, didn't I? Actually, she died. She's not that Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere in the OC? 

I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing!  So we don't get dessert? Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder? I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where? Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. Interfere? I ought to pull down your pants and spank your ass raw. Michael: I'm sorry, have we met? 

I hear the jury's still out on science. I didn't mean who… I meant… her? Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? For the same reason you should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies! 

I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. A million ****ing diamonds! You're Killing Me, Buster. See for more good stuff. Turn this skiff around! Well, Michael, I did not find their buffoonery amusing. Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car?
