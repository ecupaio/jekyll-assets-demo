title: I hate the Wetlands They re stupid and.

I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. Oh, yeah. The guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON! Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? When a man needs to prove to a woman that he's actually… When a man loves a woman… If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. 

You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. He's going to be all right. There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? 

Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where? No, she's in it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. There are dozens of us! Dozens! I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. 

Speaking of settling, how's Ann? YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. I will be a bigger and hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh! 

I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn? Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Well, if you want to play Eve, you got to get in line behind what, above five homos. I hear the jury's still out on science. 

Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. You boys know how to shovel coal? Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear. Boy, I sure feel like a Mary without a Peter and a Paul. 

Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. What a fun, sexy time for you. 

Oh, COME ON! Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. 

Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine! I'm a monster!! There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. There's a girl in my soup! 

Now, do you wanna steer, or are you too old to sit on your Pop's lap and drive? Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough.
