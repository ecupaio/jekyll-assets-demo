Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! See for more good stuff. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear. How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! No one's called him Baby Buster since high school. If mother sees this, she will blow a cow. 

I cheated and I lied and I whored around. A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! 

Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. Barry: You said spanking. Sister's my new mother, Mother. And is it just me or is she looking hotter? Well, if you want to play Eve, you got to get in line behind what, above five homos. 

She calls it a Mayonegg. When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. Barry: You said spanking. You mean the guy we're meeting with can't even grow his own hair? Come on! ¡Soy loco por los Cornballs! 

I never thought I'd miss a hand so much! Chaw-chee, chaw-chee chaw-chee! Coo coo ca cha! Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. That's my son, you pothead! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me. Gosh Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. Friend of mine from college. He also has a boat tho not called the Seaward. Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. 

Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said spanking. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy. Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep]. Everybody dance… NOW. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball! 

Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. I made a huge tiny mistake. If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. 

So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already! She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. 

Who? i just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of ann. I'm sure Egg is a great person. ¡Soy loco por los Cornballs! Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said spanking. A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! 

So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already! Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! That coat costs more than your house! The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! Oh, yeah, the guy in the the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! Yeah, I invited her. You said you wanted to spend time some with her. You said I was being an Ann hog.
