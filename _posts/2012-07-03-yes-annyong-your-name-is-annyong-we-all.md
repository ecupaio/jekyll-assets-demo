title: Yes Annyong Your name is Annyong We all.
---

Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Obviously this blue part here is the land. I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. 

I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! I never thought I'd miss a hand so much! Are you sure this isn't her sister? Mrs Veal: What a lovely thing to say. Michael: That's an awful thing to say. 

Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre. We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. 

Douche chill! I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I made a huge tiny mistake. Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep]. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. 

Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Dad asked me to do this on the day he pleads not guilty, as a spectacular protest. A…. ? [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. No one's called him Baby Buster since high school. 

Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free. Really? Did "nothing" cancel? Quicken! Premiere! Look at us, crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp. And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties. Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? 

I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray. So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. Barry: You said spanking. I hear the jury's still out on science. I'M A MONSTER!! I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! The only person that gets Lucille this excited is Gene. 

I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her! Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd gone in head first, like Pete Rose. Oh, yeah. The guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON! Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free. Really? Did "nothing" cancel? Happy Franklin Friday. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. What have we always said is the most important thing? 

Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it. ♪♪ Somewhere… over the rainbow… there's another rainbow… ♪♪ Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. 

Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F*** me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it. We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. I'm sure, wherever your father is, she loves you very much.
