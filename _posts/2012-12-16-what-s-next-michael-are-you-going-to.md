title: What s next Michael Are you going to.
---

What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha. ¡Soy loco por los Cornballs! 

Oh, COME ON! Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. NO TOUCHING! Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. 

We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.) Steve Holt? The moron jock? We all need to pick a day to try and make trend. Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing. 

Am I in two thirds of a hospital room? I'm gonna go get sexy. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard.  Everybody dance… NOW. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. 

Let's see some bananas and nuts! And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens. Why are you squeezing me with your body? You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. 

Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep]. 

This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! 

Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass. What a fun, sexy time for you. She calls it a mayonegg. If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear. I cheated and I lied and I whored around. 

Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. If that man's straight, then I am sober. 

Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. Are you at all concerned about an uprising? She calls it a mayonegg. I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship. Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter.
