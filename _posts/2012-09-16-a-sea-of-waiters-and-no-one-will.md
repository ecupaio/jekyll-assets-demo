A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. Steve Holt? The moron jock? 

Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. I just haven't had sex in a month. You know, you've been here two months. It's hard to gauge time. Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! 

Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits. Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. 

He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. A million [bleep]ing diamonds! When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle. Hey, look at that – you're mean sober, too. 

Let's see some bananas and nuts! You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. Annyong. Teamocil. 

Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well, then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. Heyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha. 

Tobias Fünke costume. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! 

So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. She's not that Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? 

Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. I'm not interested in you that way. Tobias: What way? Michael: Pick one. 

Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. One for the ladies. Are you at all concerned about an uprising? Everybody dance NOW. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight.
