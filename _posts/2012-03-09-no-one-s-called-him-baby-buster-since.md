---

No one's called him Baby Buster since high school. Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. 

And with deep, deep concentration and, and great focus, he's often able to achieve an erect– I should be in this Poof. 

You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh. I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! No one's called him Baby Buster since high school. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! 

Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. I may have committed some light treason. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. Annyong. Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. 

Heyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. - Lucille Bluth. Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken!  ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! 

Let's see some bananas and nuts! I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. 

Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep]. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? 

What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese?  Hahahahah! This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you. 

There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out. He's going to be all right. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. 

Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of funny. You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. Daddy horny, Michael. Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F*** me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being WITH you.
