Pound is tic-tac-toe, right? Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle. No one was making fun of Andy Griffith. I can't emphasize that enough. 

You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! Suddenly he's too much of a big-shot to brush mother's hair. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. 

I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. I've been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in the can. Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. 

Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Butterscotch! Want a lick? A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. 

Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. 

Fried cheese… with club sauce. Waiting for the Emmys. BTW did you know won 6 Emmys and was still canceled early by Fox? COME ON. 

Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd gone in head first, like Pete Rose. I don't appreciate the dry British humor. I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. I hear the jury's still out on science. This was a big get for God. Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? 

It's OUR nausea. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? Everybody dance NOW. Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. Well, they got the Asian right… "hotties" might be a stretch. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? 

Yes, she happens to be more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be… terrifying. I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing!  So we don't get dessert? It walked on my pillow! Well, if you want to play Eve, you got to get in line behind what, above five homos. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong? I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? 

Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. You're Killing Me, Buster.
