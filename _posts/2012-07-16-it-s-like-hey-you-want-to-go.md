title: It s like Hey you want to go.

It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. I will be a bigger and hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh! A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. 

This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. It's OUR nausea. We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. 

She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. 

Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. It walked on my pillow! 

I figured out a way to make money while I'm working! Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. Chickens don't clap! 

Actually, that was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. I'll sacrifice anything for my children. 

How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. 

Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. 

You're Killing Me, Buster. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. 

Well, Michael, I did not find their buffoonery amusing. Operation Hot Mother. Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. Bob Loblaw Law Blog.
