title: So Ann the question is do you want.
---

So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. With spicy club sauce. Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. I will be a bigger and hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh! Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. It seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb. 

Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. What have we always said is the most important thing? ♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ Let's see some bananas and nuts! I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? Mister gay is bleeding! Mister gay! Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. 

Do you have any idea how often you say the word afraid? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. I'm gonna go get sexy. And the soup of the day is bread. This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? No one was making fun of Andy Griffith. I can't emphasize that enough. Well, they got the Asian right… "hotties" might be a stretch. 

Family Love Michael. Speaking of settling, How's Ann? 

They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. I'm not interested in you that way. Tobias: What way? Michael: Pick one. 

Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Way to plant, Ann! Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. 

Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. If mother sees this, she will blow a cow. So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. 

It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. I'm sure Egg is a great person. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! 

That's how Tony Wonder lost a nut. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers! 

Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on! Friend of mine from college. He also has a boat tho not called the Seaward.
