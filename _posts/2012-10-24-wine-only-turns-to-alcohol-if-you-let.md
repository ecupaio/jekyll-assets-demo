title: Wine only turns to alcohol if you let.

Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! I figured out a way to make money while I'm working! 

I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. 

Oh Gob, you could charm the black off a telegram boy. I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. They don't appreciate him. It's his glasses… they make him look like a lizard. Plus he's self-conscious. Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere in the OC? How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? 

One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Oh, yeah, the guy in the the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! Tobias Fünke costume. 

A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits. That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. 

Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. Tobias Fünke costume. Fun and failure both start out the same way. I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! Turn this skiff around! Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist", yes. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? 

Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? But where did the lighter fluid come from? I'm sure, wherever your father is, she loves you very much. 

♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy being brown. ♪♪ Tobias Fünke costume. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. 

But where did the lighter fluid come from? I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. I hear the jury's still out on science. 

It's a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong? Heyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball!
