♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha. 

Turn this skiff around! Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. - Lucille Bluth. Oh, COME ON! Suddenly he's too much of a big-shot to brush mother's hair. Obviously this blue part here is the land. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! 

Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it. It tastes kind of like sad. In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. 

I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." I never thought I'd miss a hand so much! Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. And THAT'S why you always leave a note. 

Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. Mission Accomplished. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. Touché, Pandora. 

When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. Yes, he's like the steel man from The Wizard From Oz. Also, your knee is on my heart. Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. [Stabbing Gob] White power! Gob: I'm white! Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. 

Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. She calls it a mayonegg. You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken!  ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. 

Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. 

Quicken! Premiere! It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. Dad asked me to do this on the day he pleads not guilty, as a spectacular protest. A…. ? 

Hola, is Rosa still alive? No? Well this is not my day. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores.
