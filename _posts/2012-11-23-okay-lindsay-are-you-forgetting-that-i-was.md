Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast. For the same reason you should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies! She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! But where did the lighter fluid come from? I don't appreciate the dry British humor. 

Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. She's not that Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? Are you aware of this?  Coming soon. Indeed. 

Well, I hope you also carry a spare bowl of candy beans. My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. GENE!! [screams] 

Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. 

Heart attack never stopped old big bear. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? 

He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. Suddenly he's too much of a big-shot to brush mother's hair. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. 

Annhog's coming? The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. I'm gonna go get sexy. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. 

They don't appreciate him. It's his glasses… they make him look like a lizard. Plus he's self-conscious. A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine. Oh Gob, you could charm the black off a telegram boy. No one's called him Baby Buster since high school. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. 

She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. No, she's in it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? Way to plant, Ann! They don't appreciate him. It's his glasses… they make him look like a lizard. Plus he's self-conscious. Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON. He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. 

So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. Boy, I sure feel like a Mary without a Peter and a Paul. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point.
