title: Turn this skiff around What is she doing.
---

Turn this skiff around! What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. We'll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. Saw this on the highway and almost blue myself.  Hop on? Family Love Michael. I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! 

What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese?  Hahahahah! If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. ♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy being brown. ♪♪ No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza. You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. 

He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! 

Talk you off what, Pop Pop? Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where? I'm foolish and I'm funny and I'm needy. Am I needy? Are you sure I'm not needy? 'Cause I feel needy sometimes. If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear. 

One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. 

Today I learned this is a real place, tho more lush than the OC. Monday morning. COME ON! I made a huge tiny mistake. Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. 

I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere in the OC? Butterscotch! Want a lick? One for the ladies. Everybody dance… NOW. Oh, yeah. The guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON! 

I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. Annhog's coming? 

I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. Ah coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. They don't allow you to have bees in here. Chickens don't clap! Mission Accomplished. God knows they're squinters. 

That coat costs more than your house! Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. It was the first taste of alcohol Buster had since he was nursing. Up yours, granny! You couldn't handle it! I cheated and I lied and I whored around. Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre.
