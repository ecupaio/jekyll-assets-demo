title: No one was making fun of Andy Griffith.

No one was making fun of Andy Griffith. I can't emphasize that enough. Interfere? I ought to pull down your pants and spank your ass raw. Michael: I'm sorry, have we met? I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine. Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. 

Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit. Speaking of settling, how's Ann? 

YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. 

Smack of ham. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? It's ok. You be with Yam. This is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! 

One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. Oh Gob, you could charm the black off a telegram boy. Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. 

Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Fried cheese… with club sauce. 

Chaw-chee, chaw-chee chaw-chee! Coo coo ca cha! Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers! I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! 

Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. It was the first taste of alcohol Buster had since he was nursing. Oh, COME ON! She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. 

♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy being brown. ♪♪ Speaking of settling, How's Ann? It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. That was Tom Cruise, the actor. Lucille: They said he was some kind of scientist. 

There are dozens of us! Dozens! I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. Yes, she happens to be more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be… terrifying. I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think.
