title: Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar You want your belt.
---

Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. You want your belt to buckle, not your chair. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Pound is tic-tac-toe, right? Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. 

She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto. Heart attack never stopped old big bear. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. You can always tell a Milford man. A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. 

Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. Hair up, glasses off. He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. 

I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) I think I might have someone who's going to circumvrent the law. 

So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. Fried cheese… with club sauce. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. I may have committed some light treason. 

Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! It's ok. You be with Yam. You're blowing my mind, Frank. I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. 

Excuse me while I circumvent you. The old reach-around. Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. But where did the lighter fluid come from? How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. 

You're Killing Me, Buster. If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. And I am rock steady. No more dizzies. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd gone in head first, like Pete Rose. It's ok. You be with Yam. 

We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.) Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold. I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona. Yeah, like anyone would want to R her. 

Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit?
