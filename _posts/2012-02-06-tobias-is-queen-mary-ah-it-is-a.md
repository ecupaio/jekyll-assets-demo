Tobias is Queen Mary. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. And I am rock steady. No more dizzies. 

My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. You're Killing Me, Buster. A million [bleep]ing diamonds! Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold. Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. Hola, is Rosa still alive? No? Well this is not my day. 

Don't leave your Uncle T-bag hanging. Quicken! Premiere! 

Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! Speaking of settling, how's Ann? That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears. It's ok. You be with Yam. 

I'm sure, wherever your father is, she loves you very much. We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. This is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! Butterscotch! Want a lick? I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. Are you at all concerned about an uprising? 

Ah coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? 

That's my son, you pothead! Well, if you want to play Eve, you got to get in line behind what, above five homos. You want your belt to buckle, not your chair. 

When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! 

Hair up, glasses off. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? Let me out that Queen. Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. 

And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking.  That's not what I WAS thinking. But I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had to have the crotch taken in a little bit. Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her.
