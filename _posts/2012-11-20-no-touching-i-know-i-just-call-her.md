title: NO TOUCHING I know I just call her.

NO TOUCHING! I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball! She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. See for more good stuff. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh. Hair up, glasses off. This was a big get for God. 

What about macaroni – let me finish – salad? George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. They don't appreciate him. It's his glasses… they make him look like a lizard. Plus he's self-conscious. 

Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. I've got a nice hard cot with his name on it. You'd do that to your own brother? I said "cot." Yeah, like anyone would want to R her. What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? This was a big get for God. Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. 

Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! You might enjoy this.  Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. 

What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese?  Hahahahah! You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. You can control your bladder when you're dead! Happy Franklin Friday. But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. 

Are you at all concerned about an uprising? One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! 

Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Waiting for the Emmys. BTW did you know won 6 Emmys and was still canceled early by Fox? COME ON. I'm sure Egg is a great person. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! 

And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. Annhog's coming? Hair up, glasses off. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. 

You stay on top of her Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! 

Taste the happy, Michael! Taste it! And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking.  That's not what I WAS thinking. Talk you off what, Pop Pop? Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. Barry: You said spanking. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope.
