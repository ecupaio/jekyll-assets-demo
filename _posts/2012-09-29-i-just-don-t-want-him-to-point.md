title: I just don t want him to point.
---

I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. What about macaroni – let me finish – salad? Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. 

I'm not interested in you that way. Tobias: What way? Michael: Pick one. What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? Chaw-chee, chaw-chee chaw-chee! Coo coo ca cha! Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. You're Killing Me, Buster. I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. 

Boy, I sure feel like a Mary without a Peter and a Paul. Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. Barry: You said spanking. ♪♪ And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting. Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon delight! ♪♪ Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle. 

Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. 

Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn? It's a wonderful restaurant! Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. 

Teamocil. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. I think I might have someone who's going to circumvrent the law. 

He's going to be all right. Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? 

I see you've wasted no time in filling my seat hole. Look at us, crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp. Speaking of settling, How's Ann? She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. 

I got Michael out of his marriage, didn't I? Actually, she died. Suddenly he's too much of a big-shot to brush mother's hair. Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle. Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? Oh, yeah, the guy in the the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! NO TOUCHING! 

Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Teamocil. Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar.
