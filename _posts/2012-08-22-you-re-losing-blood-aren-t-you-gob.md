title: You re losing blood aren t you Gob.
---

You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. It's one banana Michael, what could it cost, ten dollars? Oh Gob, you could charm the black off a telegram boy. 

Aren't you the sweetest thing, spending time with what's left of your uncle. But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. It's ok. You be with Yam. Are you at all concerned about an uprising? Family Love Michael. In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong? 

Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? 

It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. Family Love Michael. Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. I don't appreciate the dry British humor. 

Chickens don't clap! Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha. That was Tom Cruise, the actor. Lucille: They said he was some kind of scientist. I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing!  So we don't get dessert? Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. 

What about macaroni – let me finish – salad? Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight. Oh, yeah. The guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON! Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. There's a girl in my soup! 

She's not that Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. 

Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. Everybody dance… NOW. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free. Really? Did "nothing" cancel? Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. Friday night. 

It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. I cheated and I lied and I whored around. I think that's one of Mom's little fibs, you know, like I'll sacrifice anything for my children. You can always tell a Milford man. If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. 

It feels good to be back in a queen! You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! You might wanna lean away from that fire since you're soaked in alcohol.
