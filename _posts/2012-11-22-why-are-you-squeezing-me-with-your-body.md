title: Why are you squeezing me with your body.
---

Why are you squeezing me with your body? You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. 

He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. This is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! Sure, let the little fruit do it. HUZZAH! I figured out a way to make money while I'm working! 

I'm sure, wherever your father is, she loves you very much. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. 

I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar. Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! I will be a bigger and hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh! No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. Pound is tic-tac-toe, right? The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers! 

I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. Hola, is Rosa still alive? No? Well this is not my day. Teamocil. If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. 

No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. We'll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.) ♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy being brown. ♪♪ I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! 

No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits. Speaking of settling, How's Ann? I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy. 

A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. I figured out a way to make money while I'm working! Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. 

After all, why should you go to jail for a crime somebody else noticed? Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. 

I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. Those are balls. Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup.
