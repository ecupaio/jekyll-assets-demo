A night of heterosexual intercourse. That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits. 

I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. 

We all need to pick a day to try and make trend. Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit. Bob Loblaw Law Blog. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? 

She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. What about macaroni – let me finish – salad? I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. 

Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. I got Michael out of his marriage, didn't I? Actually, she died. O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? I am getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and self-respect. A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! 

♪♪ And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting. Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon delight! ♪♪ Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. Now, do you wanna steer, or are you too old to sit on your Pop's lap and drive? Waiting for the Emmys. BTW did you know won 6 Emmys and was still canceled early by Fox? COME ON. 

That coat costs more than your house! There are dozens of us! Dozens! 

Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. 

So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. 

She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr.: No, not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. Are you sure this isn't her sister? Mrs Veal: What a lovely thing to say. Michael: That's an awful thing to say. So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already! I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C.
