title: Did you know that more frozen bananas are.
---

Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere in the OC? No one's called him Baby Buster since high school. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. So, what do you say? We got a basket full of father-son fun here. What's Kama Sutra oil? Maybe it's not for us. I'm not interested in you that way. Tobias: What way? Michael: Pick one. 

Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. I'm sure, wherever your father is, she loves you very much. 

They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? Well, they got the Asian right… "hotties" might be a stretch. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. 

Yeah, that's a cultural problem is what it is. You know, your average American male is in a perpetual state of adolescence, you know, arrested development. (Hey. That's the name of the show!) Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. 

If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? Turn this skiff around! Everybody dance NOW. He's going to be all right. 

I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. Tobias Fünke costume. Shémale. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? 

She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. Douche chill! And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking.  That's not what I WAS thinking. Pound is tic-tac-toe, right? 

You're blowing my mind, Frank. If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. Shémale. 

No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me. They don't appreciate him. It's his glasses… they make him look like a lizard. Plus he's self-conscious. There's a girl in my soup! 

I will be a bigger and hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh! Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball!
